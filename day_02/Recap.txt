After spending a reasonable amount of time going through the previously posted references I started with CPP, learning the syntax for different statements, checking out the keywords, and getting comfortable quantifying the logic into the programming language.
I then shifted my focus toward the Object Oriented side of the language.

Here are a few resources which helped me through this process.

1. A walkthrough video on implementing the basics of OOPs in CPP

2. A more detailed video on implementing OOPs in C++ but with additions of more explanations, and a mini project at the end.

Similar resources for OOPs in Python are:

1. A in-depth video for OOPs in Python

If you are following these things, I hope you are getting more clarity and building a better foundation for advanced things to come next.
In the next post, we will discuss using this knowledge to build a small project, to better understand things, and start with the hands-on approach.

Forward Kinematics

Given a set of links, joints, and a few defining parameters, identifying where the end effector 
will reach is what we know as Forwards Kinematics. It uses previously built knowledge from 
representing systems in their Homogenous Frames and coupling various translations, rotations, etc. 
In the end, we could easily find the position and orientation of a Robot in Euclidean Space.
Also solving a few numerical would really clear your fundamentals.

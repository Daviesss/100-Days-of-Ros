## Project Description:    
Throughout my journey as a budding robotics engineer, I found many domains and technologies like Computer Vision, Robot Kinematics, Algorithms, Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing, Control Systems, etc were required extensively in the robotics industry.
The most prominent among them all is the Robot Operating System (ROS) used almost in every advanced project.
This is my journey trying to learn these concepts one at a time,  and in a fashion that a complete beginner in robotics can follow too.  

-------------------------

## Concepts covered:  
1. Python, C++
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. ROS 
4. Github
5. Robot Kinematics
6. Computer Vision
7. Control Systems
8. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
9. Path Planning
10. Navigation
11. Manipulation
12. Data Structures and Algorithms
13. Robot Design and URDF conversion
14. Communication Protocols
15. ROS Projects

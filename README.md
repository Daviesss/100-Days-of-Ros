## Project Description
Throughout my journey as a budding robotics engineer, i found many domains and technologies like Computer Vision, Robot Kinematics, Algorithms, Sensor Data Acquistion and Processing, Control Systems, etc were required extensievely in the robotics industry.
The most prominent among them all is Robot Operating System (ROS) used almost in every advanced project.
This is my journey trying to learn these concepts one at a time,  and in a fashion which a complete beginner in robotics can follow alongside too.

## Concepts covered:  
1. Python, C++
2. Object Oriented Programming
3. ROS 
4. Github
5. Robot Kinematics
6. Computer Vision
7. Control Systems
8. Simultaenous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
9. Path Planning
10. Navigation
11. Manipulation
12. Data Structures and Algorithms
13. Robot Design and URDF conversion
14. Communication Protocols
15. ROS Projects

### TEST:
<div align="center">The derogatory term “scrub” means several different things. One definition is someone (especially a game player) who is not good at something (especially a game). By this definition, we all start out as scrubs, and there is certainly no shame in that. I mean the term differently, though. A scrub is a player who is handicapped by self-imposed rules that the game knows nothing about. A scrub does not play to win.</div>

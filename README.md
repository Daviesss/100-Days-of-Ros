# 100 DAYS OF ROS CHALLENGE

Throughout my journey as a budding robotics engineer,
i found many domains and technologies which were closley 
linked to the robotics industry.

Some of these included things like Computer Vision,
Robot Kinematics, Algorithms, Sensor Data Acquistion and Processing,
Control Systems, etc. The most prominent among them all is 
Robot Operating System (ROS) used almost in every advanced project.

This is my journey trying to learn these concepts one at a time, 
and in a fashion which a complete beginner in robotics can follow alongside too.

## Package Description:      
The intention of developing this package was to take something as simple as turtlesim, use reference from other projects, and develop a cool game out of it using ROS.
The inspiration for this project was drawn from [ros-turtle-pong](https://fjp.at/ros/turtle-pong/)
This repository hosts the source code for the ROS `day_30` package, which implements the Pong arcade video game for the Robot Operating System (ROS 1 Noetic) using turtlesim.

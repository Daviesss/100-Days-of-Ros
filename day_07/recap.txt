DAY 07  [100 Days of ROS]

Bag Files, TurtleSim and Github

With a good amount of basics cleared on the last day,
I could finally move to some hands-on experience. 
I started with bag files and saw various implementations and use cases. 
Recorded a few bag files with help of the rosbag command
and used additional parameters to have fun. On playing back the bag file, 
it struck me that they still weren't perfect and were utterly dependent upon
the performance of a system to retrace the steps.

Next, I moved on to TurtleSim. 
It is really a very light simulator and could be used to learn a lot 
about basic things like topics, nodes, ros messages, etc. 
After spending some time with it, I used my previous knowledge of bag files
to record and playback the shape traced in turtlesim.

Finally, I moved to work on my GitHub repo and have started adding relevant details
and beautifying it for a better presentation.

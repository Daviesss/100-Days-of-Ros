Control Systems

Control systems are important in robotics because they allow robots to perform tasks accurately and repeatably. 
Robots often have to deal with a complex and dynamic environment, and control systems help them to do so by 
allowing them to sense their surroundings, make decisions, and execute tasks.

They are used for:

1. Controling the motion of the robot:
Control systems can be used to control the motion of the robot's joints and end effectors 
(e.g., grippers or welding torches).

2. Sense the environment:
Control systems can be used to process data from sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, or sonar)
to help the robot understand its environment and make decisions.

3. Execute tasks:
Control systems can be used to execute functions by coordinating the motion of the robot and 
its end effectors in response to sensor data.

Day Breakdown:
Focus on learning the theory behind control systems. 
This will take quite a long time but once you have a good foundation we can focus on different types of controllers.

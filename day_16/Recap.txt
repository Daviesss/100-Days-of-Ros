Robot Kinematics

A study of the relationship between a robot's joint coordinates and its spatial layout. 
Kinematics has a special emphasis on robotics. In simple terms, we use it to understand 
the various motions of a manipulator. Here are a few resources to learn kinematics from scratch.

Degrees of Freedom
This relates to the Freedom a body has for its various movements in Euclidean Space. 
The number of constraints acting on a system reduces this freedom and leaves us 
with a number representing the real freedom of the body.

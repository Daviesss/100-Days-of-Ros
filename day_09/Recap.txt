Day 9 [100 Days of ROS]

ROS Mini Project

After having completed the ROS basics, it's time to implement it on a small project to test the learning. I decided to do a project on turtlesim to trace a path.
It's very easy to draw basic shapes, so I wanted to try something complex. I decided to write ROS with turtlesim but using topics and services to achieve this feat.
I used a simple pub-sub model clubbed with a service client to teleport my turtle, make it lift the pen up and down, and finally make it trace a programmed path. I decided to opt for an open-loop control system to reduce the complexity. After having complemented the program, I analyzed it to find that the structured manner was difficult to interface with various variables. Thus I will now move this code to an object-oriented paradigm and see how much of a difference it will make.

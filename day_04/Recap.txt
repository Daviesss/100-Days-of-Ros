DAY 04  [100 Days of ROS]

Meeting the #community .
I had initially planned to carry out the 100 days of ROS challenge alone, but after posting a few developments on LinkedIn, I got a tremendous response from all fellow #robotics #engineers that they wanted to be a part of this series.
I then made a #discordserver where everyone could participate, share resources, ask doubts and help each other out on this journey.

Here is a quick snippet from a google meet we had discussing our plan of action for the next few days. (P.S. see if you could spot yourself in this picture)

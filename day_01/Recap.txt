DAY 01    [100 Days of ROS]
 
Earlier we made a list of things to cover. Let's start with the most fundamental thing on the list. 
Programming Languages. The most important ones curtailing our requirements are Python and Cpp.
 
Here are some resources for python that I've used:

(YouTube)
1. Good to revise python and see the implementation through a project

3. In-depth explanation of concepts

4. Focus on the OOPs side of python (essential with big ros projects)

Additional Recommendations:

A great resource to learn Cpp also focuses on Object-oriented data structures, 
ordered and unordered data structures (recommended by Nicolas Z. Tan )

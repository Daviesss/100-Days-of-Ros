Day 12
Coordinate Transformations
Started by learning Euclidean Geometry and describing the 2D coordinates in a matrix. Then studied carrying out Translation, Rotation, and Scale Change individually and combined in a Euclidean Space. These concepts are very important and lay the foundation for Kinematics.

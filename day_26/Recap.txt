Building Cool ROS Projects

(In Short :
Finding FUN ROS projects, making them, and sharing the process of building)

Up until now, 25 days have elapsed, which I've utilized to cover many concepts like Basic programming, Intro to OOPs, ROS basics, Control Systems, Robotics Theory, Kinematics, etc.
But honestly, nothing of it holds any value if you can't apply these concepts to some problem statement and devise a working solution out of it.

This brings me to PROJECTS.
Learning through implementing #projects is a highly effective way to master a new skill or technology, especially for learning #ros .
By working on projects that require you to apply ROS concepts and tools in a practical setting, you gain a deeper understanding of how ROS works and develop the skills and confidence to tackle more complex robotics challenges in the future.

Thus I embarked upon searching for some #opensource projects where I can use the previously mentioned skills and make something fun out of it.
Fun for me to make.
Fun for others to join in too.

And thus I encountered the following resources:

https://lnkd.in/dB3-7xwQ
https://lnkd.in/d2T--ZVU
And tons more.

I compiled through a lot of them until I found something FUN,
which I will disclose in the next post.
But I felt more than just making a project...
I should properly document my building methodology, and the logic I follow to reach there. That essentially can help anyone to make anything they wish. So a few next days will cover this methodology in detail, shedding light on how to tackle this problem.

Here is a link to the GitHub repo where all this is happening:

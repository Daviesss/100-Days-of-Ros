Ping Pong with TurtleSim

After searching through a lot of projects,
I settled down on trying to recreate a version of
TurtleSim Ping Pong!

I drew my inspiration from Lentin Joseph sir's post on robotacademy
where he mentions this project made by Franz Pucher. 
I immediately fell in love with this project.

Not only was the project simple to understand, but it also was easy to tinker with and recreate.
I could see so many essential concepts like the PubSub model, Services, Kinematics, etc 
were utilized to build it and it rewarded very handsomely by being able to play with your final developed project.

So I cloned the repo locally (thanks to the power of #opensource ) and started reading through how it was implemented. 
The project had a launch file that runs different ros nodes in succession. Here's the breakup:
1. An init node will be called to launch all packages and set them up in a way ready
with multiple turtles subbed to their respective cmd_vels.
2. Another node that will control the entire logic for the ball bouncing around in the arena. 
Things like checking or bounds, making it traverse from one point to another, teleporting on edge cases, etc.
3. A traditional teleop_key node to help move the two turtles and hit the ball.

And that's it. That is all there is to this wonderful project.
In the remaining time, I went through the source code in detail and made a few keynotes
on what I wanted to do differently in my version of Ping Pong.

In the next few days, I will hit on the topics of how you reverse engineer such projects, 
go about writing sample code to test the functionality of small segments, and eventually 
package everything in a nice little folder. Hang around for that.

P.S. If you're still reading make sure to star the repo here...

Until then, here is a quick sneak peek of the completed project...
Happy Building !!!
